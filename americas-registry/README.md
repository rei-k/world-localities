# Americas: region-by-region enrichment and audit loop

This is a **logical Americas (UN M49 019) integration layer**. It does not
move or duplicate large existing locality datasets, rewrite source identities,
or change third-party licences.

## Strict area order

| Order | Area | UN M49 | Countries/areas with a locality source | Missing sources in current publication |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | [Northern America](../north-america-registry/README.md) | 021 | 5 / 5: US/CA source snapshots + BM/GL/PM GeoNames packs | None for source-pack coverage |
| 2 | [Central America](../central-america-registry/ENRICHMENT_20261015.md) | 013 | 8 / 8: six preserved GeoNames packs + Costa Rica supplement + separate INEGI Mexico | None for source country layers |
| 3 | [Caribbean](../caribbean-registry/README.md) | 029 | 28 / 28 GeoNames country-area packs | None for source-pack coverage |
| 4 | [South America](../south-america-registry/README.md) | 005 | 16 / 16 GeoNames country-area source packs | None for source packs |

The Northern layer adds three **partial GeoNames source packs** (BM, GL, PM).
Its separate **18-name government-attested administrative seed catalogue** is
not counted as locality coverage and is never merged with gazetteer rows. The
Caribbean layer now includes Cuba's GeoNames country extract; this does not
mean an official ONEI dataset was acquired.

Across these four M49 areas, **57 / 57 country-area source packs** are now
included. This records a usable source layer for each M49 area; it does not
claim full official municipal, locality, address, postcode, street, or
translation completeness. Bermuda, Greenland, Saint Pierre and Miquelon and
Cuba use GeoNames source gazetteers. South America's 16/16 is also source-pack
coverage, not official municipal coverage. Missing or unresolved source rows
remain explicit and are not synthesized.

UN M49 calls Northern America (021), Central America (013) and the Caribbean
(029) parts of the larger North America (003). Mexico is in M49 Central
America, regardless of colloquial use of "North America". Puerto Rico is
in M49 Caribbean and is present in the **US Census source** as US-PR, so this
view excludes its 1,231 US-source rows from Northern totals while preserving
the original source and independent Caribbean layer.

## Execute one audit / obtain the improvement queue

Run at the repository root, with Python 3.11+ standard library:

    python americas-registry/audit.py --mode audit > /tmp/americas-audit.json
    python americas-registry/audit.py --mode plan > /tmp/americas-plan.json
    python americas-registry/audit.py --mode cycle --rounds 3
    python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_americas_unified.py' -v
    python scripts/verify_americas_snapshots.py

The audit checks: unique M49 placement, source country membership,
expected source totals, northern/central/Caribbean coverage hashes and
GeoNames payload replay, official US/CA/MX index totals, source completeness
flags, pending scope, and explicit PR/MX cross-region accounting. It does
**not** re-download official sources, run authoritative name QA, or verify
delivery addresses.
For preserved US/CA/MX/BR snapshot-bytes and parent-chain validation use
the independent `scripts/verify_americas_snapshots.py` command.

`--mode plan` produces a deterministic queue ordered by area, starting with
official-source and reuse-rights follow-ups before language/postal and
Address1 gaps.
`--mode cycle` rechecks the areas sequentially, stops on no input changes,
and **does not pretend that repeated audits add records**. Ingestion,
legal source review, QA and commits must occur between enrichment rounds;
re-run these checks after any such change.

## Required ingestion and publication gates

- **Scope and identity:** M49 country-area roster, ISO code, role,
  versioned source identifier and provenance; avoid "same name = same place".
- **Hierarchy:** closed/acyclic parent chain where source allows it; unresolved
  parents must remain reported, never filled by unreliable guesses.
- **Language:** distinguish verified English/local names, original-language
  strings, transliterations and machine-generated suggestions.
- **Postal:** use exact postal scheme/code as string (leading zeros intact),
  evidence, coverage relation and validity; one-to-many/many-to-many links.
- **Street and Address2:** separately record licensed road names, range or
  house number, premise and subpremise evidence. Reject unsupported "full
  worldwide address validation" claims.
- **Publication:** source licences and attribution, stable snapshots,
  checksum verification, reproducible builds, negative tests and human approval
  of new country claims before merging.

Source licences still apply: preserved US/CA/MX/BR snapshots include
ODbL-linked material; GeoNames packages are CC BY 4.0. Retain original
notices. Official-source candidates without a verified redistribution licence
remain research references, not copied datasets. Base layers must not be
silently replaced by cross-source merge results.

See [the 2026-10-18 review of the four formerly missing sources](MISSING_SOURCES_REVIEW_20261018.md)
for source choices, licences, row counts and remaining official-data gaps.

Central America now validates actual gazetteer payloads and the pinned Costa Rica raw archives through `quality_cycle.py`; the legacy six-country raw ZIP replay is still a separate task. The government 84-canton CodeSystem remains separate from the 82 ADM2 records in the Costa Rica GeoNames snapshot.
